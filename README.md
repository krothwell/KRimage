## User guide

When using KRimage for the first time, a directory should be added before doing anything else as
the initial way to load images to view and assign to albums, but can later be removed if desired.

### Adding a directory

1. Click on ‘File’ in the top menu bar, then ‘Add image directory’
2. Browse to a folder containing images
3. Select the folder, and click ‘Open’.
4. KRimage will load image thumbnails in to the window.

### Adding an album

Albums can be used to help you organise images.

1. Think of an album name you would like to put images in.
2. Select ‘File’ in the top menu bar, then ‘Add new album’
3. A window will open asking you to enter the album name, write the name in the text field
    and click ‘OK’. The album will appear in the list to the upper left of the window.

### Assigning images to an album

1. Select a directory you have added in the lower left hand side of the window.
2. Right click an image thumbnail and select ‘Assign or remove album(s)’
3. A window will open showing the image with a list of albums to the left of it.

### Viewing images

Select a previously added directory or album from the left hand side of the window.

Images held in the directory or assigned to the album will be loaded in to the window as thumbnails.

There are three options when viewing an image.

1. View an image by double clicking an image thumbnail.

This is the default way to view an image, opening the image in a window centred in the screen.

2. View full screen: slect an image thumbnail, and then select ‘Image’ from the main menu, and select ‘View image full screen’

The image window takes up the whole screen space.

3. View maximum sized image: select an image thumbnail, and then select ‘Image’ from the main menu, and select ‘View maximum sized image’

The image is rendered at its actual size, you can use scroll bars if the image is really big to move round the image.

### Remove an album or directory

1. Right click on the directory or album to the left of the window
2. Select the option to remove.

### Rename an album

1. Right click on the album to the upper left of the window.
2. Select the option to rename.
